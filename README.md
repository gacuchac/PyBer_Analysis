# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
For that, a summary DataFrame and a line plot were created.

## Results
As can be seen from the following table, the *Total Rides*, *Total Drivers* and *Total Fares* columns all seemto be directly correlated with *Rural* being the smallest, the *Suburban* and *Urban* the largest. When analysing the *Average Fare per Ride* column, the city type does not appear to be an indicator of this variable, but with *Average Fare per Driver* column, the relationship seems to be the opposite of those first columns.
